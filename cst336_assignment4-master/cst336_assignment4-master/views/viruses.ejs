        <p>Definition: A computer virus is a type of computer program that replicates itself by modifying other computer programs using its own code.</p>
        <p>History: The Creeper virus was first detected on ARPANET, the precurson to the Internet, in the early 1970s. 
        Creeper was a  self-replicating program written by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies in 1971. 
        Creeper used the ARPANET to infect DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system. 
        It gained access via the ARPANET and copied itself to the remote system where the message, "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" was displayed.</p>
        <p>Modern Usage: There are many phases during a virus as well as types of computer virus. 
        Viruses have an infection mechanism, a trigger, payload, and copying phase. 
        Many viruses today can be transmitted through .exe files, emails, documents, and many other types of files.</p>
