        <p>Definition: A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology. 
        Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pair or fiber-optic cables, or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi.</p>
        <p>History: In the late 1950s, early networks of computers included the U.S. military radar system Semi-Automatic Ground Environment. In 1995, the transmission speed capacity for Ethernet increased from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps and by 1998, Ethernet supported transmission speeds of a Gigabit. The ability of Ethernet to scale easily, such as with fiber optic cable speeds, is a contributing factor to its continued use.  </p>
        <p>Modern Usage: In a society like today, computer networks plays a major role for everyone. Almost every electrical device we use today relates to networking whether that be phones, laptops, appliances, and even smart homes.</p>
